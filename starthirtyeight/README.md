A new Flutter project.

## How to Run

## Todo to clean up app
- When a new user phone number has no lists when the user navigates to "view previous lists" in step 1 there should be a condition where it states "you have not made any lists yet!"
- When clicking ok on making a new list in step 1, the text should change (good/bad) based on the return of the http request
- in Step 2 need error handling return that says when you cant import a number as it has already been added (as pop up modal)
