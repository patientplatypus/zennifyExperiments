# starthirtyeight

A new Flutter project.

## How to Run

## Todo to clean up app
- When a new user phone number has no lists when the user navigates to "view previous lists" in step 1 there should be a condition where it states "you have not made any lists yet!"
- When clicking ok on making a new list in step 1, the text should change (good/bad) based on the return of the http request
- in Step 2 need error handling return that says when you cant import a number as it has already been added (as pop up modal)
- Lists in step1 and step2 are slightly too tabbed at the top and not tabbed enough at the bottom.
- settings Menu cards are slightly offset and i dont know why
- fix margin card issue on step2 delete button animation.
- figure out why slideTransition is not working.
