# starthirtyeight

A new Flutter project.

## How to Run

## Todo to clean up app
- When a new user phone number has no lists when the user navigates to "view previous lists" in step 1 there should be a condition where it states "you have not made any lists yet!"
- When clicking ok on making a new list in step 1, the text should change (good/bad) based on the return of the http request
- in Step 2 need error handling return that says when you cant import a number as it has already been added (as pop up modal)
- Lists in step1 and step2 are slightly too tabbed at the top and not tabbed enough at the bottom.
- settings Menu cards are slightly offset and i dont know why
- fix margin card issue on step2 delete button animation.
- turn off slide transition for delete when menu button back, switch submenu or bottom menu.
- change name of "settings screen" to "rocket screen" and replace middle phone icon on bottom bar with cog and make a "cog screen"
- fill out card at top of step2 with more information about list.
- consider styling date picker in step 3 when done with everything else.
- add a way to delete a list and not just the numbers in the list (may need to change list options in step1).
- add loading icons (spinners) for anything that takes a hot sec to load (ie list in step1)
- Edge case handling on step3 when user asks for settings that dont make sense.
- Fix jump from back button appearing on totalNum phone number display.
